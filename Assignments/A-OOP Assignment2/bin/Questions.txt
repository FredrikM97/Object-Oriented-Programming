Question 9)

What does the application programmer need to do to write a complete application?

The framework includes a center component with four buttons that contains the four directions. 
The different abstract methods or classes are needed to be implemented if the programmer should be able to complete the project.

Question 10)

What classes did you define to specialize the framework for this application?

We created a class SlidePresenter that extends the abstract class Presenter that extends JFrame and implements ActionListener.
From this we use our Task10 in the main class to create a SlidePresenter.
